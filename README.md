# 🪙 Cryptos Token

**Cryptos Token** is a smart contract-based cryptocurrency project built with Solidity and deployed using Hardhat. This project is part of a blockchain initiative by **Team Cryptos** to explore secure, decentralized token systems that can power digital payments and asset transfers in modern applications.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ ERC-20 Token Implementation
- 🔐 Secure Smart Contract written in Solidity
- 🧪 Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment
- 📝 Automated deployment script
- 🧾 Organized project structure (contracts, scripts, tests)
- ⚙️ Easy integration with wallets or DApps

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Solidity** – Smart contract language
- **Hardhat** – Development environment for Ethereum
- **JavaScript** – Deployment and testing scripts
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment

## 🚨 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**


git clone https://github.com/CD-wise/Cryptos-Token.git
cd Cryptos-Token

2. **Install dependencies**

npm install

3. **Compile the contracts**

npx hardhat compile

4. **Run tests**

npx hardhat test

5.**Deploy to local or test network**

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

💡 You can configure other networks (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia) in hardhat.config.js

🧠 Future Goals
